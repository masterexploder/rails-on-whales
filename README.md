# Rails on Whales

This repository contains all the example code that's used as a part of my series
on what makes a good development environment, and how one can be built for a
Rails app using Docker and Docker Compose.

You can read all about it here:
[https://ianselby.me/rails-on-whales](https://ianselby.me/rails-on-whales)

I've modified the files slightly to be more like templates that can be used for
any project. You can get a quick overview on their usage in my
[Rails & Docker Cheetsheet](https://ianselby.me/rails-on-whales/rails-and-docker-cheatsheet)
